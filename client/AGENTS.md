src/
  routes/          # TanStack Router file-based routes
  components/ui/   # shadcn/Radix UI components

## Conventions

- **Do NOT edit** `src/routeTree.gen.ts` — auto-generated by TanStack Router plugin.
- Routes go in `src/routes/`. File name = route path.
- Use `hcWithType` from `"server/client"` for typed API calls.
- Import schemas/types via subpath: `from "shared/api/hello"`.
- Path alias: `@/*` → `./src/*`.
- Styling: Tailwind classes + `cn()` from `lib/utils.ts`.
- Only package that needs `build` (Vite bundles for production). Shared/server changes are available immediately.
