# usecases-home

Home navigator app lives under `usecases-home/`.

## Purpose

- Entry page for all use case demos.
- High-level how-to guide for trying the demos.
- Wallet setup and download guidance.
- Credential issuance guidance.
- General Vidos context for users.

## Rules

- Keep homepage/navigation content in this workspace.
- Keep use case-specific implementation details in `../usecases/<name>/`.
- Prefer relative imports, except Shadcn components that use TS path aliases.
