## Why

DemoBank requires an entry point that introduces users to PID-based banking, explains the EUDI Wallet concept, and provides a clear navigation structure with visual progress tracking throughout the authentication and action flows. Without this foundation, users cannot navigate between signup/signin, dashboard, and transaction flows, nor understand their position in the journey.

## What Changes

- Add landing page (`/`) with DemoBank intro, 1-2 sentence EUDI Wallet + PID explainer, and CTAs for "Create Account" and "Sign In"
- Implement visual progress indicator component showing user's position in journey (Intro → Authenticate → Action → Finish)
- Configure TanStack Router with route structure and authentication guards
- Create responsive base layout component with progress indicator integration
- Setup route guards to protect authenticated pages (dashboard, profile, send, loan, confirm/success routes)
- Mobile-first responsive design matching modern banking aesthetics (N26, Revolut style)

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `landing-page`: Homepage introducing DemoBank with hero section, EUDI Wallet explainer (1-2 sentences), and primary CTAs ("Create Account", "Sign In"). Clean, modern banking aesthetic suitable for investor presentations.

- `progress-indicator`: Visual journey tracker component displaying user's current step in the flow. Shows completed steps, current step (highlighted), and upcoming steps. Adapts based on flow type (signup vs signin, payment vs loan). Steps: Intro → Authenticate → Action → Finish.

- `route-structure`: TanStack Router configuration defining all application routes with proper authentication guards. Routes include: `/` (landing), `/signup`, `/signin`, `/dashboard`, `/profile`, `/send`, `/send/confirm`, `/send/success`, `/loan`, `/loan/success`. Auth guards prevent unauthorized access to protected routes.

- `responsive-layout`: Mobile-first base layout component with navigation header, progress indicator integration slot, and main content area. Responsive breakpoints supporting iPhone SE through 27" desktop displays. Includes account menu for authenticated users (sign out, reset demo data).

## Impact

**New files:**
- `client/src/routes/index.tsx` - Landing page route component
- `client/src/components/ui/progress-indicator.tsx` - Journey progress component
- `client/src/components/layout/base-layout.tsx` - Main layout wrapper
- `client/src/components/layout/auth-guard.tsx` - Route protection component
- `client/src/lib/route-config.ts` - Route definitions and metadata

**Modified files:**
- `client/src/main.tsx` - Router setup and layout integration
- `client/src/routeTree.gen.ts` - Auto-generated by TanStack Router

**Dependencies:**
- No new dependencies required (using existing TanStack Router, React, Vite stack)
- Relies on existing UI component library (shadcn/Radix)

**System impact:**
- Establishes navigation foundation for all subsequent page implementations
- Defines reusable layout pattern for authenticated vs unauthenticated flows
- Creates visual language for user journey tracking used across all flows
